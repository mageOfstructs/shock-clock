# ShockClock

An Android app that controls an electroshocker via Low-Energy-Bluetooth. The goal of this project is too offer a free, easy and open-source solution for a aversion therapy device.
The app is able to trigger a shock through a variety of triggers:
    1. Manual
    2. Opening an App (currently requires the app's identifier, which is readily available on Android)
    3. Keyword (if a specified keyword appears on screen)
    4. Website (if the user tries to access a blacklisted website)

- This project was made for the 2024 HTL Villach Projectdays and achieved first place amongst third grade and third place overall
